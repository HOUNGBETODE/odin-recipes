        <h2>Descriptions</h2>
        <p>Use coconut milk for a tropical twist
            on classic flan.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>    
            <li>¾ cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1 cup coconut milk </li>
            <li>½ (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
            <li>½ (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                Grease 6 (4-ounce) ramekins.</li>
            <li>Slowly melt sugar in a large skillet over low 
                heat, stirring constantly, until browned but
                 not scorched, about 8 minutes. Divide 
                 caramel equally among the ramekins and 
                 allow to cool.</li>
            <li>Combine whole milk, coconut milk, 
                evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk,
                 and vanilla extract in a saucepan over 
                 low heat. Stir continuously until it 
                 begins to steam, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk 3 eggs together in a bowl; slowly 
                pour beaten eggs into the warm milk 
                mixture, whisking constantly until the 
                custard is combined.</li>
            <li>Place ramekins in a casserole dish and 
                fill with boiling water to reach halfway 
                up the sides of the ramekins. Divide custard
                 evenly among ramekins, over the caramel 
                 sauce, about 1/2 inch from the top. Cover 
                 casserole dish tightly with foil. Bake in 
                 the preheated oven until the custard is set,
                  about 1 hour. A knife gently inserted into 
                  the center of a flan should come out 
                  clean.</li>
            <li>Remove ramekins from the water bath and allow 
                to cool to room temperature. Refrigerate for
                 2 to 3 hours before serving to chill 
                 completely. Run the tip of a paring knife 
                 around the edges to release the flan. Place
                  a plate over the top of the ramekin and 
                  flip to release the flan onto the plate, 
                  caramel side up.</li>
        </ol>
