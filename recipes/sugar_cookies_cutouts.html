            <li>In a medium bowl, cream together
                 the butter and sugar. Stir in 
                 the eggs and vanilla. Sift 
                 together the flour and baking 
                 powder, stir into the creamed 
                 mixture alternately with the 
                 heavy cream. Cover dough, and

                roll out the dough to 1/4 inch 
                thickness. Cut into desired 
                shapes with cookie cutters. 
                Place cookies 1 inch apart on 
                the prepared cookie sheets. 
                Sprinkle with colored sugar if

                the preheated oven, until bottoms 
                and edges of cookies are light brown.
